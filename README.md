# Python functions

###  *1.	What does the len() function do in Python? Write a code example using len() to find the length of a list*

### **The len() function determines the number of items in an object. It can be applied to various data types, such as strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries etc**

### *2.	Write a Python function greet(name) that takes a person's name as input and prints "Hello, [name]!"*

### *3.	Write a Python function find_maximum(numbers) that takes a list of integers and returns the maximum value without using the built-in max() function. Use a loop to iterate through the list and compare values*

### *4.	Explain the difference between local and global variables in a Python function. Write a program where a global variable and a local variable have the same name and show how Python differentiates between them*

**Local variables in Python are those which are initialized inside a function and belong only to that particular function. It cannot be accessed anywhere outside the function. Global variables  are those which are defined outside any function and which are accessible throughout the program, i.e., inside and outside of every function.**

### *5.	Create a function to calculate_area(length, width=5) that calculates the area of a rectangle. If only the length is provided, the function should assume the width is 5. Show how the function behaves when called with and without the width argument. Note: For the theory or explanatory parts of the questions, you may include your explanations as comments within the Python file itself. Alternatively, you can provide detailed explanations in a separate Word/PDF document and upload it along with your assignment.*

**While creating the function,  given the  default value of the width as 5 , so that each time execute it will take the width as 5. There are two cases one with  only the length is provided by the user and it will take the default  width  assigned  and calculate the area. Second case, user is providing both the length and width and the system will calculate the  area based on the value provided.**
